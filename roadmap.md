# Wynd Roadmap 2022

The Wynd Foundation has designed the following roadmap to launch the Wynd DAO and help nurture it.
As the Wynd Community grows and the Wynd DAO becomes active, it may undertake many more actions,
which we cannot not yet plan for. Consider this a basic outline of our direction, and a starting
point for the Wynd journey, not a complete guide:

## Aidrop Tokens (Early Q2)

The Wynd Foundation will create the $WYND token on the Juno network and airdrop it to many active
participants in the Cosmos ecosystem. The full airdrop rules will be published later
(TODO: link here along with tokenomics). There is no pre-sale and the foundation and team maintain
a reasonable portion to help guide and grow the protocol.

After the Airdrop, the Wynd Foundation will work to establish a solid liquidity pool in a Cosmos AMM
to provide stable price discovery for the $WYND token.

## Launch Wynd DAO (Late Q2)

Once the tokens have been claimed and a stable price acheived, we will launch the Wynd DAO,
likely building off the DAO-DAO software with heavily customized staking rules. A DAO is not
just a voting contract on the blockchain, but a community that must engage in informed discussion
and healthy debate. Along with the on-chain elements, we will build up off-chain forums for
the community to form and generate ideas.

## Wynd Auto-Compounder (Early Q3)

One of the visions of Wynd is environmental DeFi, harnessing the income of DeFi and directing it to
environmental purposes. The Wynd Foundation will build out a simple application to provide some initial
revenue for the Wynd DAO and serve as inspiration for future protocols. 

The Auto-Compounder is basically a fund manager. You can send your $JUNO to the auto-compounder and it
will stake them on your behalf, reinvesting all rewards every day in order to safely provide you higher APY
without any extra work. We will also use various optimizations to provide shorter unbonding periods on average.
This should provide the best and safest staking experience for $JUNO holders and will take a 5% cut of
the withdrawn rewards to fund the Wynd DAO.

## Wynd Oracles (Q4)

One of the fundamental pilars of Wynd is using satellite data to bring near real time environmental data to the blockchain.
Once the data is available, it can be the basis for many protocols. However, it is a long slope to get there. 
In order to support the whole ecosystem, the Wynd Foundation will provide grants to build out this infrastructure for
the common good, with the intention that the Wynd DAO can launch products that will utilize it.

We may also launch an NFT project in a future moment, but work will only begin once the main milestones have been acheived
in order to allow us to focus on delivering the core value proposition of Wynd.
