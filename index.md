# Introducing Wynd DAO

**The Wynd DAO will leverage blockchain protocols to protect and regenerate the world's ecosystems.**

As we enter the year 2022, every living soul on this planet can see and feel the drastic changes happening around the globe. Humans are the most intelligent species and hence can observe, calculate and deduce the cause-effects on a larger scale. Irrespective of education, degree and skills, every human on this globe can see the damage to the environment, the deterioration in climate conditions, and the increasingly extreme weather conditions. We have large scale fires, frequent storms and only 50-60 crop cycles remaining on the global scale.

We strongly believe that the current sad and grim state **can** be changed and transformed into a harmonious state. However, this can't be done until we awaken and are compassionate towards nature and all its creatures, and then _align our actions with our beliefs_. Unfortunately, most people who awaken to the need to reverse the damage to our planet are left feeling helpless.

We realize that we can't rely upon a few people sitting in governments to take actions to bring a sustainable ecology to this planet; that all current economies are fundamentally based on increasing exploitation of "natural resources"; and that "lifestyle changes" like eating organic or donating to the WWF are far too small to turn the tide. Yet, what can we do?

Bringing forth a truly sustainable future requires everyone, or at least a large majority of people, to be involved in the process. Until recently, there have only been two successful approaches to large scale organization - hierarchical systems like governments and large corporations, and competitive games that exhibit emergent behavior, like market economies. Horizontal organizations, like coops, often show increased efficiency and democratic participation in the areas they have been applied, but have worked well only at relatively small scales.

**What's revolutionary?**

Wynd sees the potential of blockchain technologies to engender new forms of large-scale collaboration toward positive, life-affirming futures. Cryptoeconomics and mechanism design allow projects to create new competitive games with different emergent behavior than market economies. DAOs are in their infancy, but have already shown great potential enabling large groups with a common purpose to quickly form and take collective action.

Wynd uses technology to bring awareness and visibility to all humans about their surrounding environment and put true value on it. We provide a platform to make them an active contributor, not just limited to the scope of WYND or any one organization, but in the immense scope of life itself. We seek to achieve harmony between nature and technology while rewarding everyone who has put their skin in the game in any form under this belief system.

Wynd views itself as part of the [ReFi movement](https://je.mirror.xyz/S-dpms92hw6aiacUHoL3f_iAnLVDvbEUOXw7wpy7JaU) and aligns with the general vision of the [Green Pill Party](https://greenpill.party/). We also build upon years of experience in real-world, offline collectives and horizontal governance. Some of us have been working on mechanisms to go [beyond coin voting governance](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/08/16/voting3.html) for years, both in theory and in implementation. And take inspiration from decades of ideas, best summarized in [Buckminster Fuller's World Game](https://www.bfi.org/about-fuller/big-ideas/world-game/):

"Make the world work, for 100% of humanity, in the shortest possible time, through spontaneous cooperation, without ecological offense or the disadvantage of anyone"

WYND strongly believes and is committed to build a better, healthy world with the current technology which is web native/scale; building infrastructure, tools and services around that to support and enhance the entire ecosystem. This enables everyone to have some learning and role to contribute for a better world as a whole rather than just limiting it to an individual's benefits.
