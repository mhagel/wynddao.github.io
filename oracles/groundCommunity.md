***[Why Earth Restoration Organisation should get on-board with
WYND]{.ul}***

**Problem** - At the end all Earth restoration projects need efforts around optimising their
"limited resources" - Human Resource, Financial Resource, Data Resource.
Right now working in silos or limited collaboration.

**Solution** -

The following subsections describes the existing struggles in realising
the goals of the organisations and how WYND can help not only in
providing solutions to these struggles but also acts as a growth
platform for the organisation and the larger community as whole.

1.  **Existing Silos / Limited Collaboration**

> In the current state most of the restoration projects are working in
> silos at almost all levels of operations. This has led to improper
> resource utilisation and much can be achieved through collaboration.
> WYND can act as a trustless system for any restoration program in
> terms of decision making, data sharing, and adoption of best
> practices. This helps in better resource allocation like which data
> needs to be collected on ground, what data should be analysed for
> getting the most out of it.

2.  **Data backed quality index**

> Most projects/organisations fail to provide quality indexes for
> justifying their cause and efforts which are widely accepted or can be
> used for providing any financial support from banks and investors.
> WYND will help organisations to have widely accepted and provable
> quality indexes thus enabling them to have a wide reach and acceptance
> to Financial and Governmental sectors. WYND will enable all parties to
> have a clear view of benefactors in the whole ecosystem backed by data
> from varied sources - satellite imagery, sensors, ground data
> collection etc.
>
> WYND will act as a trustless verifiable data catalogue for an
> organisation.

3.  **Defi - Welcome to Blockchain**

> Even if somehow an organisation is capturing some quality indexes to
> assess their performance and can be used by a bank for justifying the
> loan, Restoration projects are still limited with options in terms of
> getting financed in traditional banking and investment markets. WYND
> can exponentially increase the reach of restoration programs and
> projects in getting financed for their causes directly from De-Fi.
>
> WYND gives direct access to the de-fi community. Following are some of
> the services that can be realised by any restoration program/NGO in
> order to not only increase their reach to get financed but also better
> utilise their existing assets for generating revenue.
>
> Gets direct access to finances from the de-fi community based on the
> restoration project or cause backed by data.
>
> Gets direct access to data marketplace in order to monetize their data
> sources without having the need to have technical know-how for
> accessing the technology.
>
> Gets direct access to a community of data scientists, engineers for
> finding better algorithms or calculating the quality index itself for
> the organisations.
>
> Gets direct access to developers from Dapps ecosystem who may end up
> consuming some data service provided by the organisation. Insurance,
> NFT, Games etc.
>
> Gets timely updates on new data sources, quality indexes, results,
> practice adoptions from all other community members.
>
> Get access to methodologies of creating new assets from generated
> revenue to further monetize the newly created assets.
