# Token Distribution

WYND belongs to the people, not to wealthy VC firms. That is why we have decided not to
do any private sales or investment rounds at all and rather self-fund the project to launch.
We will make a fair distribution of all genesis $WYND tokens without any renumeration in return.

**At genesis, there will be 108 million $WYND tokens.**

Of these tokens, we will distibute them as follows:

* 20% Wynd Foundation
* 15% Development Team
* 65% Airdrop

Yes, almost two-thirds of the total token supply will be fair-dropped on active Cosmos citizens!
We are working on a design that is hard to game and fairly distributes among real citizens,
and look forward to encouraging a vibrant and active community around the Wynd DAO.

The Wynd Foundation is a registered BVI Entity and will be issuing these tokens.
It will issue 20% of the supply to itself to help guide and fund the Wynd DAO in first months and years.
These funds will be used to ensure sufficient liquidity of the $WYND token, fund development projects
like the Oracle service, and fund another other actions for the good of the community.

The development team fund will reward those who put in energy to bring this too launch, but will
also leave some funds in reserve, controlled by the Wynd Foundation, to reward important contributors
who join the DAO after launch.

Please note that most of these tokens will be subject to a vesting period to limit initial liquidity and
avoid quick dumping. The foundation will have around 25% of their token supply liquid on day one so they
can help establish the LP pools. But all the rest of the genesis tokens will be vesting on various schedules.
