# $WYND Token

The foundational layer of the project is the $WYND token, which is minted by the protocol.
This token will serve as a governance token for the [Wynd DAO](/governance).

While designing the tokenomics, we spent time to make this token sustainable, not just environmentally,
but also financially. We do not want to repeat the mistakes of [Klima DAO](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/klimadao/),
which tried to contribute to the environment, while replicting [Olympus DAO's Ponzi-omics](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/olympus/). (Look at 1Y graph to see what I mean). 

We would rather "slowly" grow 5x over 1 year, then make a 100x in 2 months just to loose it all in the following 2 months.
We feel [OSMO](https://info.osmosis.zone/token/OSMO) and [JUNO](https://info.osmosis.zone/token/JUNO) are better
models of a growth curve to aim for.

We accomplish this by providing real value to the Wynd DAO (governance backed by real projects, which drive long-term value),
and by slowly increasing the liquidity via vesting rather than a huge dump of liquid tokens to start with. We also feel
3-digit APRs are inherently unsustainable and the Wynd DAO will focus on longer-term incentives for HODLers not
for yield farmers.
