# $WYND Fairdrop

As we have seen the drama on some chains when dealing with the consequences of gamed airdrops,
we will not be releasing details of how the calculation is performed until after the snapshot is taken
and the claim period starts. We will only provide general information for now, and expand this page once
the claim period is live.

We are doing our best to make this distribution "fair". Not just by releasing 65% of the tokens to the general public,
but also in how we select the participants. We will seek to exclude any accounts tied to centralized exchanges
and only grant to people in possession of their own tokens.

## Goals of Airdrop 

Cosmos has many chains and many active contributors in many different forms. We wish to invite as many of
them to as possible to participate in the birth of the Wynd DAO. We have looked at many other airdrops
and are doing our best to learn from the successes and failures of them. One notable item is to avoid people
looking to "game the system" and quickly dump any airdropped tokens. For this reason, all airdropped
tokens will be vesting, meaning that they can be used for voting and staking from day one, but it will
take a full year until they can all be freely transferred and sold.

## Timing

We will take snapshots of the relevant chains in early April and perform the calculations based on
those values during the month of April. In mid to late April, we will release a site allowing you
to view how many tokens will be allocated to your address. The acutal claim period will begin late April
or early May. More exact dates will be posted as we progress on the preparations for launch.

## Multichain Claims.

You will need to provide your Juno address to view your portion and claim it, but we will match accounts
on other chains to the corresponding Juno address and perform the airdrop on one chain. This also means
you will need a 0.001 $JUNO or so to pay gas fees, which should should easily be able to get on Osmosis.

If you are in possession of your private keys in Keplr or in a Ledger, generating the Juno address should be no problem.
If your keys are stored in a local binary (say `gaiad`), you should be able to port them to another binary (`junod`), and
we hope to provide a document on how to do this for the normal case. In the worst case, you can import them
in Keplr or a Ledger if you have the mnemonic.

If you keys are held by a custodial solution, you may be out of luck and must discuss it with the custodian.
And if you manage your keys with an uncommon solution, we cannot provide support, except to show how to import your
mnemomic into another solution.
